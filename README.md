# Reading Room

**Reading Room** is a full-stack web application where book lovers are able to keep track of their books while connecting with friends. This is handy for those who want to keep an organized list of the books they have read, books they are currently reading, and books they want to read in the future. You can even track your progress!

Begin by searching for a book by its title or author. From there, you will have the option of adding a book to your shelf. Your bookshelf is accessible through your *dashboard* or your *shelves*. And of course, you can search for other users and add them as friends! If you're curious, you can take a peek at their bookshelf, too.

Reading Room uses data from the [OpenLibrary API](https://openlibrary.org/developers). It is created by Maria Acuna, who has fallen into the hole of purchasing-and-collecting-many-books-but-will-seldomly-read-one-from-start-to-finish. Within the past year she has started 7 books, and finished 1. It is a deep hole. You can find Maria on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-html/). If you have any curiousities, feel free to email her [here](mailto:maria.pv.acuna@gmail.com).
