# Book Buddy

The goal of my app is to provide a space where users are able to create virtual shelves for their books, add other users as friends, and keep track of their (and others!) reading.

This app will target book lovers of all genres. For those who are in book clubs or those who are casually reading books with friends, some features will be especially useful.

The data will be coming from the OpenLibrary API [here](https://openlibrary.org/developers)


## Features
- Search function based on author, genre, book title
- Ability to see details about a specific book (book cover, title, number of pages, synopsise etc)
- Virtual bookshelf (carousel or list format) showing finished books, currently reading and future reads
- Add friends!
- Ability to update how many pages you have read in a book
- See which books you and a friend have in common
- Rating a book on a scale of 1-10

## User Flow

Users will be asked to register for an account in order to use its tools. Otherwise, the app is available simply to search for books. Once signed in, the user is directed to their dashboard, which will include their profile (username, full name, description) and links to their shelves. Clicking on one of of the shelves will show a carousel of the books on that shelf (list view will also be an option).

Users will have the option of adding friends by sending friend requests to another user's username. Users will have a friend list where clicking on a friend will go to their profile and show that user's shelves and books they have in common.

__Stretch Goal__: Have a display log of users' latest actions (adding books to shelves, updating progress on book) as well as their friend's updates.
